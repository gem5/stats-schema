# Dec 4

- started fiddling with json output

- Do we only want to print metadata once?
  - How to encode this in the schema

- Start with not worrying about components
- Start without worrying about the metadata

- Then, we could, as a proof of concept, always output the metadata

- SST stats
  - Accumulator: output 5 values
    - Sum of data added
    - Sum of squares
    - Number of times data added
    - Min
    - Max
    - Probably need to add a new data type
    - In many stats, the accumulator has useless data when used as a scalar
    - Jason: Add new accumulator datatype
  - Histogram

- Jason: worked on python library (see /python) and writing tests for the schema (see /tests)
