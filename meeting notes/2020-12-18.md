## Bobby and Gwen's updates

- Working on json output for gem5
  - Mostly in accordance with Jason's schema
  - Question: what output type should we support?
    - Currently just scalar and distribution
  - Do we need to support other gem5 types
    - Vectors, 2d vectors, sparse histograms, etc. formulas
  - Comfortable with just scalar, dist, and array/vector

- Need to add an accumulator type from SST
  - By default all are accumulators
  - It has other fields like, sum, count, sum squared, min, max
  - Don't bind stat type until runtime
  - Each stat can be accumulator or histogram
  - accumulator is histogram with one bin
  - Jason will add a type for this to the schema

- SST has a separate statistic for each instruction type
  - Not sure if this is the best way

- 2D: memory components x memory bins
  - definitely have examples of cross products

- Array of values, and a separate array of names
  - Could also represent it as an object
  - Jason will into extending schema to support this datatype

- SST: have stats that are mutiple instance of same stat
  - Kind of maps to a vector
  - E.g., same stat for each core
- CPU has multiple cores
  - one stat that has an ID for each core
- Other models just have cores
- Outcome: Keep it as raw as possible!

- Having a way to aggregating across models is very important
  - Need to have flexibility here.
  - The user may want to sum up a subset of "memory controllers"

- SST: how to do time series output
  - Problem: repeating structure for each outptu
  - For now, let's keep the json
  - We'll come back to figure out timeseries
