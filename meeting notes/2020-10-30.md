- Prometheus
  - Still needs a schema
  - Gives application dev a set of abstractions
  - Generation of HTTP requests
  - Seems somewhat like a time series database
    - And a data aggregator
    - and a scraping tool
    - Could just be a pass through
  - Simulator would connect to prometheus server
  - Need to tell prometheus what to pick up
  - Mostly just a hierarchical database
  - Missing a way to dump the "end" of simulation
  - Main use case: On line monitoring
  
- Do we want to target the schema to tie into prometheus?

- TSDB and prometheus might be solving a bit of a different problem

- Probably want to have prometheus as a back end.

- One thing if we want to support time-series database
  - Need to output all events, can't aggregate first and then send to DB
  
- Interesting idea
  - Use this to monitor the *simulator*, not the simulated system

- Look at other event databases as outputs
  - Make sure that nothing we're talking about will make this harder
  - Influx DB <https://www.influxdata.com/>

- How to make time series timestamps compatible
  - Probably just want "relative" information
  - Should time be an integer or float (seconds)
  - Can we have both?
  - A function for converting

- A concept of time
  - A conversion from simulation quantum and seconds
  - Define this as a type
  - Can be component-specific so you can specify time
  - A version of timespec struct?
  - Do we need two 64 bit numbers, just in case?

- Need to think about how to handle DVFS
  - How to handle clock cycle reference stats
  
- Require idea of a time in the output

- Allow each model to have a different idea of "time"

- How to keep track of the timebase for each component
  - Default to using the parent

- Storage types
  - May need a timespec
  - How to represent binary data
    - Have a pointer

- Action itmes
  - Jason will add the time idea
  - Need to think about what will actually go into the schema
  - For next time: Come prepared to talk about storage types
    - Do we need other storage types?
