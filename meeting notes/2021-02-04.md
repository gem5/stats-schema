To discuss:
- Updates on stats
- Clock sync between gem5 and SST

Integrated Stats are being merged, now close to completed.

Jason starts conversation on keeping clocks between gem5 and SST. SST has multiple event queues one per MPI process.

Ahmed - SimBus - SST is a consumer. Triffle or DynamoRIO sends a budget of cycles in SST and then it can go for that amount of cycles. No need for explicit synchronization.

Arun+JLP: SST drives the clock and wakes gem5 event queue. Gem5 event queue impl can be chosen dynamically so it can be changed to the one that works with SST. We could insert a synchronization point in gem5 EQ for g5 to stop simulation and give SST ack to continue before SST wakes g5 back again.

Triffle runs all threads concurrently, so SST could be seen as one more thread in the whole simulation - so that'd be a different model in the case of Triffle.

MPI in SST - conservative distance optimization. Check links between components across processes and their latencies to define a Slack and prevent timing violations.
