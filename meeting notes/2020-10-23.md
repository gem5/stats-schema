- Google xml/html metadata for indexing: intelliG?

- Time series
  - What is the time interval
  - Deviation of interval
  - Timestamps

- Need different output schemas
  - json output (full)
  - json compressed
    - Separate metadata
  - hdf5
  - csv
  - csv time series (csv transpose?)

- May want to support packed formats for stats values


- Prometheus (standard in industry)
  - https://prometheus.io/
  - Java/javascript
  - No c++ library
  - Graphana
  - Can be "online"

- Need to add schema version
  - Encode specialization
- Can different components have different stats schemas?
  - Need backwards compatibility between schema versions

- Can we auto generate the output generators?
  - A benefit of json-schema is that it can be checked
  - Specify interface between simulator and the auto-generated "printers"

## To do for next time
- Research prometheus
  - How does this relate to json-schema?
  - Schema vs output?
- Figure out time series
