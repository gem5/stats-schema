# Meeting notes Nov. 4, 2020

- How to deal with different stats that have different intervals

- Might need to have a timestamp per stat/model

- Floating point numbers for time is bad

## Next steps

- Develop the jsonschema document
  - Document the schema carefully
  - Need to add comments in the jsonschema

- Develop a proof of concept for a single "dump" in json format

- Develop other alternative output formats' schemas
  - These can be defined as the conversion functions from json to the other format
- What's the intermediate output
  - Autogenerate print functions for output
    - Can autogenerate instrumentation
    - But could to the output
    - *Need to check if jsonschema can auto generate python*

- On the gem5 side
  - Output stats from python
  - Develop a proof of concept?

- Could start with a "partial" schema and then work on the output in SST or gem5
  - Mock up the incomplete schema
  - SST has a json output already which could be copied and modified in small ways
  - Will work on an SST proof of concept!
